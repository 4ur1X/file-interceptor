## File Interceptor

This is a python program that allows an attacker to replace victim's download request from a webpage with any other download file. With this, an attacker can replace the file with a malware or any other file while it's in transit.

<strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to run the ARP Spoof (in another repository) program before running the file interceptor.

Usage syntax: ````python3 file_interceptor.py`````
